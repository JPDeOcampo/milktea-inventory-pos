# Milk Tea Inventory System with POS

This repository contains the source code for a Milk Tea Inventory System with Point of Sale (POS) functionality, developed using VB.NET and MySQL. This system was created in 2019 as a school project during college, specifically targeting the OMT (Oh My Tea) milk tea shops. While this system is not complete, it aims to provide efficient management of inventory and streamlined sales transactions.

# Features
- Inventory Management: The system provides a user-friendly interface to manage milk tea ingredients, including adding new items, updating quantities, and removing items. It allows tracking the availability of ingredients in real-time.

- Order Management: Users can place customer orders by selecting the desired milk tea type, size, and additional toppings. The system calculates the total price based on the selected items and updates the inventory accordingly.

- Point of Sale (POS): The system offers a POS interface where employees can process customer transactions. It enables easy order entry, calculates the total amount due, and generates printable receipts for customers.

- User Authentication: The system includes user authentication to ensure secure access. Different levels of access can be defined, such as admin and cashier, with specific privileges and restrictions.

- Reporting: The system generates various reports, including daily sales, flavor sales report, and stocks report. These reports aid in decision-making, inventory management, and tracking business performance.
